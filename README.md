## How to Play

### Rules

The game consists of a 3x3 board and each player, alternately, play "X" or "O", with the objective of completing a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line.
In each turn, the current player choose one of the squares enumerated from 1 to 9, and passes the turn to the next player who has to choose an avaiable square to make it's move.

The game ends in 3 conditions:
 - If the player choose the '0' number
 - One of the players make a full line
 - If there is no more avaiable spaces

 Any invalid value will return invalid and ask the player to type it's choice again.

### Executing

To execute the file, if it is on the 'Downloads' open the terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and paste using (ctrl + v) the next two lines :

cd Downloads/Microver-Tic-Tac-Toe/bin
./main.rb
